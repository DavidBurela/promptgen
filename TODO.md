# TODO

Running list of things I need to address in this codebase. Once it's in better shape this'll likely migrate to a github Project or Issues.

- [x] I know I'm not using `commander` the right way for loading the bindings, need to fix that
- [ ] Need example of multiple partials for constructing a skill-using GPT scenario
- [ ] Need example of GPT -> Midjourney prompt generation, check with Nick Floats to see if I can use some of his stuff

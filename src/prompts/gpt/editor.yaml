  You are to help me edit a piece of writing. I will give you some writing, and you must critique it on the following criteria:
  - Ensure that the content matches the expected {{tone}} tone
  - Determine whether the {{structure}} structure is followed and how well, and suggest improvements
  - Give me tips for making sure I connect with my {{audience}} audience
  - Let me know if the {{length}} length needs adjusting
  - Give me any other feedback you have
  Finally, if you think it needs it, rewrite the content to be more effective.
  
  The output format should be as follows:
  FEEDBACK:
  Any of the feedback you have, as a bulleted list

  REWRITE:
  The rewritten content
